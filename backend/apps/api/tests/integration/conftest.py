"""Integration-test harness — hits the live uvicorn pid on :8002.

Fixtures:
  * `client`       — httpx.AsyncClient pointed at RECEIPT_INTEGRATION_URL
                     (default http://localhost:8002). Fails loudly if the
                     backend isn't reachable (no silent skip).
  * `clean_db`     — autouse; truncates events → sessions → hook_tokens
                     before every test so each test sees a pristine DB.
  * `authed_client`— mints a fresh hook-token via
                     POST /api/v1/auth/hook-token and returns
                     (client, user_email, token) with the Bearer header set.

Unit tests live in the parent directory; this package is selected with
`-m integration` and excluded from default runs via pyproject addopts.
