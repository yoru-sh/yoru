"""Feature access dependencies.

Resolution order (highest priority first):
  1. user_grants          — admin overrides with optional expiry
  2. subscription → plan_features — what the user's active plan grants
  3. features.default_value       — fallback for unplanned users

The SaaSForge feature-check middleware (`middleware/feature_check.py`) was
designed to read `request.state.required_feature` set by this dep, but
`BaseHTTPMiddleware.dispatch()` runs before route dependencies resolve, so
the state is always empty when the middleware reads it. We do the check
inline in the dep instead — one fewer moving part, works.
